TODO:

figure out error messages with pitchshifter~.pd
same with ringmod~ and ringmod~~
maybe not anymore

I think I messed up hann_table-help.pd

update sigbiquad_coeff-help.pd (still is a copy of mmb's help file). Same with sigbiquad~-help

fix transistor~-help.pd

something happened to autospectrum

mention that [gate 3] is different than [gate3] and will produce an error in xcode

Some patches have been removed from the library but are still in Users_Guide.pd
